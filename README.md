This file includes the simualtions of the Quantum ISING MODEL, the ground state energies governed by Ising model using the Pennylane library, eigenvectors and eigenvalues matrices. 
Additionally, this also includes the construction and plotting of simple Quantum circuit with all kinds of GATES applied. The operations can be performed on IBM QML composer for the output prediction.
